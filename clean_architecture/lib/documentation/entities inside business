the entity is the article of the news

This code defines a Dart class called `ArticleEntity` that represents an article. It extends `Equatable`, which is used to make value comparison easier in Dart.

### **Code Breakdown**

#### **1. Importing Equatable**
```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';
```
- This imports the `equatable` package, which allows us to compare objects based on their values rather than memory reference.
- Normally, in Dart, two instances of a class are considered different even if they contain the same values. `Equatable` fixes this by enabling deep comparison.

---

#### **2. Defining the `ArticleEntity` Class**
```dart
class ArticleEntity extends Equatable {
```
- `ArticleEntity` is a data model representing an article.
- It extends `Equatable`, meaning we can compare two articles based on their content.

---

#### **3. Declaring Properties**
```dart
  final int? id;
  final String? author;
  final String? title;
  final String? description;
  final String? url;
  final String? urlToImage;
  final String? publishedAt;
  final String? content;
```
- These are the properties of an article.
- All fields are marked as `final`, meaning they cannot be changed after initialization.
- The `?` (nullable type) means these fields can have `null` values.

**Explanation of Properties:**
- `id` â†’ The unique identifier for the article.
- `author` â†’ The name of the article's author.
- `title` â†’ The title of the article.
- `description` â†’ A short summary of the article.
- `url` â†’ The link to the full article.
- `urlToImage` â†’ The URL of an image related to the article.
- `publishedAt` â†’ The date and time when the article was published.
- `content` â†’ The full content of the article.

#### **4. Defining the Constructor**
```dart
  const ArticleEntity({
    this.id,
    this.author,
    this.title,
    this.description,
    this.url,
    this.urlToImage,
    this.publishedAt,
    this.content,
  });
```
- This is the constructor of the class, used to initialize the object with values.
- The `const` keyword ensures that if two objects have the same values, they will be treated as the same instance in memory.
- The parameters are optional (because of `this.` with nullable types).

---

#### **5. Overriding `props` for Value Comparison**
```dart
  @override
  List<Object?> get props {
    return [
      id,
      author,
      title,
      description,
      url,
      urlToImage,
      publishedAt,
      content,
    ];
  }
```
- `props` is a getter that returns a list of properties that should be used for comparison.
- This is required by `Equatable`, allowing two `ArticleEntity` instances to be considered equal if all their fields are the same.
- If two objects have the same `id`, `title`, `author`, etc., they will be considered **equal**.

---

### **Why Use Equatable?**
Normally in Dart:
```dart
var article1 = ArticleEntity(id: 1, title: "News");
var article2 = ArticleEntity(id: 1, title: "News");

print(article1 == article2); // false (Different objects in memory)
```
With `Equatable`, the same comparison:
```dart
class ArticleEntity extends Equatable { ... }

print(article1 == article2); // true (Same values, so considered equal)
```

---

### **Use Case**
This class is useful for managing news articles in an app, such as:
- Storing articles in a list.
- Comparing two articles.
- Fetching and displaying articles in a Flutter app.

---

### **Summary**
- `ArticleEntity` is a data model for an article.
- `Equatable` allows value-based comparison.
- Properties are final and nullable.
- `props` enables proper equality checking.
- The constructor initializes values.
